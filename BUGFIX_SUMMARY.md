# Bug Fix Summary: File Processing Error

## 🐛 **Problem**
The application was failing with the error: "expected bytes, UploadedFile found" during X-ray and medical report analysis.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `HealthcareController` was passing Streamlit's `UploadedFile` objects directly to the AI agents (`XRayAgent` and `ReportAgent`), but these agents expected raw bytes for image processing with the Gemini API.

## ✅ **Solution**
Modified the `HealthcareController.process_files()` method to:

1. **Import required utilities:**
   ```python
   from utils.image_helpers import process_image_for_gemini, validate_image_file
   ```

2. **Add file validation and conversion:**
   ```python
   # For X-ray files
   if not validate_image_file(xray_file):
       raise ValueError("Invalid X-ray image file")
   
   xray_bytes = process_image_for_gemini(xray_file)
   if not xray_bytes:
       raise ValueError("Failed to process X-ray image")
   
   # Pass bytes instead of UploadedFile
   xray_result = self.xray_agent.analyze_xray(xray_bytes)
   ```

3. **Applied same fix for medical reports:**
   ```python
   # For medical report files
   if not validate_image_file(report_file):
       raise ValueError("Invalid medical report file")
   
   report_bytes = process_image_for_gemini(report_file)
   if not report_bytes:
       raise ValueError("Failed to process medical report")
   
   # Pass bytes instead of UploadedFile
   report_result = self.report_agent.analyze_report(report_bytes)
   ```

## 🛠️ **Files Modified**
- `healthgenie_app/agents/controller.py` - Added file conversion logic

## 🧪 **Testing**
- ✅ Created and ran comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Verified file validation works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed byte conversion produces valid image data
- ✅ Tested agent imports and initialization
- ✅ Application now runs without file processing errors

## 📝 **Key Learnings**
1. Streamlit's `UploadedFile` objects need to be converted to bytes before passing to AI APIs
2. The existing `utils/image_helpers.py` already had the required conversion functions
3. Always validate files before processing to provide clear error messages
4. The `process_image_for_gemini()` function handles image optimization (resizing, format conversion) automatically

## 🎯 **Result**
The application now successfully processes both X-ray images and medical reports without the "expected bytes, UploadedFile found" error, enabling the full AI analysis workflow to complete successfully.
